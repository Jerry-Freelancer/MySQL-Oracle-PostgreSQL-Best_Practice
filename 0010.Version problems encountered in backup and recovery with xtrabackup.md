## <p align="center"> Version problems encountered in backup and recovery with xtrabackup</p>
I received a customer's question about using xtrabackup for backup and recovery yesterday.

After restoring the data, start the database and get the following error:

```shell
[root@mydb01 backup]# cat error.bak
mysqld: Can't open file: 'mysql.ibd' (errno: 0 - )
2023-06-28T10:57:00.337276Z 0 [System] [MY-010116] [Server] /mysql/app/mysql/bin/mysqld (mysqld 8.0.16) starting as process 24546
2023-06-28T10:57:02.960302Z 1 [ERROR] [MY-013171] [InnoDB] Cannot boot server version 80016 on data directory built by version 80018. Downgrade is not supported

```

We can obviously see the error message here.

```
2023-06-28T10:57:02.960302Z 1 [ERROR] [MY-013171] [InnoDB] Cannot boot server version 80016 on data directory built by version 80018. Downgrade is not supported
```

So I checked mysql and xtrabackup versions in the process of backup and recovery, and found that they were inconsistent.

The version of production database is 8.0.18.

The version of the test database is 8.0.16.

This has led to the above problems.



The solution to the problem is very simple. Upgrade the test database to 8.0.18, and the database starts successfully.

**PS: Regarding the recovery of xtrabackup backup, the recommended scheme is that the versions of mysql and xtrabackup for backup and recovery must be consistent. Otherwise, the database will not start.**

There will be version problems or problems caused by undo in the log.

Attached undo problem log:

```shell
