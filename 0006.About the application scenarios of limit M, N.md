## <p align="center"> About the application scenarios of limit M, N</p>

I have a British customer who built an online store by himself with about 4 million items, but there is a search module on his website, the corresponding SQL statement, and the query result set is more than two million rows. 35-40 seconds to show completed.

This obviously does not conform to the user's browsing habits, so we need to use the limit M, N statement.

The LIMIT clause in MySQL is used to limit the number of results returned by a SELECT statement. It can be helpful when you want to view a small subset of the data in a large table or when you want to display results in a paginated format.

```sql
mysql> create database db01;
mysql> use db01
mysql> create table product_info(id int primary key,product_name varchar(50),price decimal(6,2));
mysql> insert into product_info values(1,'Widget A',10.99);
mysql> insert into product_info values(2,'Widget B',15.99);
mysq > insert into product_info values(3,'Widget C',20.99);
mysql> insert into product_info values(4,'Widget D',25.99);
mysql> insert into product_info values(5,'Widget E',30.99);
mysql> insert into product_info values(6,'Widget F',35.99);
mysql> insert into product_info values(7,'Widget G',40.99);
mysql> insert into product_info values(8,'Widget H',45.99);
mysql> insert into product_info values(9,'Widget I',50.99);
mysql> insert into product_info values(10,'Widget J',55.99);
mysql> insert into product_info values(11,'Widget K',60.99);
mysql> commit;
```

```sql
mysql> select * from product_info limit 3,2;
+----+--------------+-------+
| id | product_name | price |
+----+--------------+-------+
|  4 | Widget D     | 25.99 |
|  5 | Widget E     | 30.99 |
+----+--------------+-------+
