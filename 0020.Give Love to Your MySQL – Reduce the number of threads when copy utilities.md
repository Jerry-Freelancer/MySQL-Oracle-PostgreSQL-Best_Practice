# Give Love to Your MySQL – Reduce the number of threads when copy utilities.



### MySQL Data Migration Case: Balancing Threads and Resource Utilization

Today, I was tasked with helping a client migrate their MySQL database to a new server. To handle the data transfer, I chose to use the `mysqlsh` tool, which is generally efficient for large-scale migrations. However, we ran into several challenges during the process, which, after careful analysis and adjustments, we were able to resolve successfully.

#### The Problem

Initially, to speed up the migration, I configured the Threads parameter in `mysqlsh` to be close to the server's CPU core count, hoping that using multiple threads would fully utilize the hardware. But shortly after the migration began, the task frequently failed, returning an error related to too many Threads. Even though the number of Threads was set below the total CPU core count, the migration still failed to proceed smoothly.

I turned to the server's monitoring tools and checked system resource usage. It became clear that the root cause was that the `mysqlsh` process was consuming nearly all of the server’s CPU and memory resources, which overwhelmed the system and led to the migration task failures.

#### In-Depth Analysis

As I dug deeper, I realized that, despite the high number of CPU cores, increasing the Threads count does not linearly improve performance. Each thread competes for CPU resources and memory bandwidth, and this high concurrency created significant strain on the system, especially when the disk I/O was already under heavy load. The excessive concurrent operations disrupted resource allocation, which ultimately caused the copy failures.

Another critical factor was disk I/O. During the migration process, the speed of reading and writing to the disk often becomes a bottleneck. Upon inspection, I found that the disk I/O peaks were nearing the hardware limits, meaning that even if the CPU had spare capacity, the disk couldn’t keep up with the large number of concurrent writes.

#### The Solution

##### 1. Adjusting the Threads Parameter

After thoroughly analyzing how system resources were being allocated, I decided to reduce the number of Threads in `mysqlsh`. From experience, when the number of Threads exceeds 50% of the CPU cores, performance often degrades. Therefore, I halved the Threads count to match half of the CPU cores, allowing each thread more CPU resources and reducing the overhead caused by excessive thread scheduling.

##### 2. Optimizing Disk I/O

While reducing the number of Threads helped, disk I/O remained a key area to address. I also adjusted the `maxRate` parameter in `mysqlsh`, which controls the maximum data transfer rate, ensuring that the disk I/O wasn’t overloaded. By capping the data write rate, I prevented disk I/O from becoming a bottleneck during the migration.

After making these adjustments, I restarted the migration task. This time, CPU and memory usage remained stable, and disk I/O did not spike under high load. The migration proceeded smoothly without any further failures.

#### Results and Reflections

With these optimizations, the entire data migration process became more stable and efficient, ultimately leading to a successful task completion. This experience reinforced the importance of careful resource management, especially when dealing with database migrations that consume significant system resources. It’s not always about using more threads; too many can overload system resources and degrade performance.

Additionally, disk I/O, often overlooked during data migrations, must be given enough attention. Even if there is plenty of CPU and memory available, a bottleneck in disk I/O can slow down the entire process. Moving forward, I will place more emphasis on comprehensive system resource monitoring and optimization in similar projects.
