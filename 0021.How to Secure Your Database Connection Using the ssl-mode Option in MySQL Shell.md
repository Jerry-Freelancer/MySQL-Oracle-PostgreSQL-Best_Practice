\## <p align="center">How to Secure Your Database Connection Using the `ssl-mode` Option in MySQL Shell</p>



### 1、Overview

In this blog, I will share a customer case focused on troubleshooting and resolving an SSL error encountered while connecting to a MySQL database using MySQL Shell. In this scenario, the customer experienced the following error message: 

**MySQL Error 2026 (HY000): SSL connection error: error:0A000102 routines::unsupported protocol**

. This error indicates that the SSL protocol in use is not supported, likely due to a mismatch in SSL/TLS configurations between the server and client. In this post, we will explore the possible causes, related `ssl-mode` configuration options, and offer practical guidance for diagnosing and resolving such issues.

### 4、Summary

In this case, the customer encountered an SSL protocol error while connecting to a MySQL database using MySQL Shell. The specific error message was: **MySQL Error 2026 (HY000): SSL connection error: error:0A000102**

**routines::unsupported protocol**. This issue was caused by a mismatch between the SSL/TLS configurations on the client and server, likely due to an incompatibility between the MySQL version and the supported SSL protocols.



Upon analyzing the customer’s MySQL configuration and Shell connection options, it was determined that the root cause was that the server required a higher or different SSL protocol version than what the client supported. To resolve the issue, we advised the customer to update the SSL/TLS settings on both the MySQL server and client to ensure they supported the same encryption protocols. Additionally, we suggested configuring the `ssl-mode` option in MySQL Shell, such as setting it to `DISABLED` if SSL was not needed, or adjusting it to `PREFERRED`, `REQUIRED`, or other options to match security requirements.

### Solution Summary:

1. **Check MySQL Version and SSL/TLS Configuration**: Ensure that both the server and client support the same SSL/TLS protocol versions.
2. **Adjust the `ssl-mode` Parameter in MySQL Shell**: Choose the appropriate SSL mode (`DISABLED`, `PREFERRED`, `REQUIRED`, `VERIFY_CA`, or `VERIFY_IDENTITY`) based on your needs.
3. **Upgrade or Reconfigure OpenSSL**: Make sure that MySQL Shell and the server are using compatible OpenSSL versions, especially when using newer TLS protocols.

By following these steps, the customer successfully resolved the SSL connection issue, ensuring secure and stable connections with MySQL Shell.
